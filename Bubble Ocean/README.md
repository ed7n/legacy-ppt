## About

Bubble Ocean is my fourth PowerPoint game. I have a faint memory of it being
developed on the family PC and my first PC with PowerPoint 2007. I used to keep
copies of its revisions before this final release. However, a disaster brought
those down to just the initial release version--dated 04/10/2011. This release
was packaged with the `iexpress` utility.

All of its music are stolen from various video games I leave you to discover.
Much of its graphics are also stolen from various Internet sources and CD-ROMs.
The hand drawings are mine, however.
