### History

The ideas behind this project were envisioned in early 2016 before I departed
for college. I had this end goal of making the most out of PowerPoint's
limitations as a "platform" for interactivity, and the best way to achieve this
was to integrate what I had in audio engineering and UI design. In my opinion,
the blend went pretty well, making this the highest-profile PowerPoint
presentation I have ever done in my life (as of 07/07/2018).

This project also marked the first time I worked semi-professionally, the most
notable difference being the planning. I prepared the source materials prior to
composing the slides. The game stages ("depths" as the game calls them), began
as a bunch of four-sided figures plotted within the outlines of a graphing
paper, I drew the outline while a friend did the shading to distinguish between
spaces and walls. The music was actually stolen from The Apprentice, a game for
the Phillips CD-i multimedia system, simply because, but it was more than just a
straight rip off. I ripped the CDDA stream out of the CD image and picked
certain sections of it and turned them into individual tracks to be re-mastered.
It was a time-consuming process as each track had processed differently due to
how they were originally processed.

I put the project on hold in July 2016 and finally abandoned the whole thing in
early 2017 mainly because of personal reasons. Furthermore, PowerPoint 2010 does
not work well on recent computers (my Dell Latitude 5480 being an example), and
the later versions are financially difficult to obtain. I have the physical
source material tucked inside a binder and an archive of the project files, who
knows that they may come in handy when I feel like working on them again.
